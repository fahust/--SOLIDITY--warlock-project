## Solidity Good Practices

| Ref | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Zero knowledge proof](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/) | Accelerating the mass adoption of crypto for personal sovereignty |
| [byte32](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11556/use-string-type-or-bytes32) | Use strings for dynamically allocated data, otherwise Byte32 is going to perform better. Bytes32 is also going to be better in gas |
| [Use uint instead bool](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/39932/solidity-bool-size-in-structs) | It's more efficient to pack multiple booleans in a uint256, and extract them with a mask. You can store 256 booleans in a single uint256 |
| [.call()](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transfer-vs-send-vs-call-function-64c92cfc878a) | using call, one can also trigger other functions defined in the contract and send a fixed amount of gas to execute the function. The transaction status is sent as a boolean and the return value is sent in the data variable. |
| [Interfaces](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_interfaces.htm) | Interfaces are most useful in scenarios where your dapps require extensibility without introducing added complexity |
| [Change State Local Variable](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/118754/is-it-more-gas-efficient-to-declare-variable-inside-or-outside-of-a-for-or-while) | It's cheaper to to declare the variable outside the loop |
| [CallData](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce) | It is recommended to try to use calldata because it avoids unnecessary copies and ensures that the data is unaltered |
| [Pack your variables](https://mudit.blog/solidity-gas-optimization-tips/) | Packing is done by solidity compiler and optimizer automatically, you just need to declare the packable functions consecutively |
| [Type Function Visibility](https://www.ajaypalcheema.com/function-visibility-in-solidty/#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20types%20of,internal%20%2C%20private%20%2C%20and%20public%20.&text=private%20modifier%20specifies%20that%20this,by%20children%20inheriting%20the%20contract.) |  This is the most restrictive visibility and more gas efficient |
| [Delete Variable](https://mudit.blog/solidity-gas-optimization-tips/) | If you don’t need a variable anymore, you should delete it using the delete keyword provided by solidity or by setting it to its default value |
| [Immutable / constant variable](https://dev.to/jamiescript/gas-saving-techniques-in-solidity-324c) | Use constant and immutable variables for variable that don't change |
| [Unchecked state change](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/optimizing-smart-contract-gas-cost-harold-achiando/) | Add unchecked {} for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow |
| [Use revert instead of require](https://dev.to/jamiescript/gas-saving-techniques-in-solidity-324c) | Using revert instead of require is more gas efficient |
| [Index events](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8658/what-does-the-indexed-keyword-do) | The indexed parameters for logged events will allow you to search for these events using the indexed parameters as filters |

| [Hyper ledger factory](https://www.ibm.com/fr-fr/topics/hyperledger) | Hyperledger Fabric, an open source project from the Linux Foundation, is the modular blockchain framework and de facto standard for enterprise blockchain platforms. |
| [Chain link](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) | Oracles provide a bridge between the real-world and on-chain smart contracts by being a source of data that smart contracts can rely on, and act upon |
| [UniSwap](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/guides/quick-start) | |
| [Reentrancy](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/re-entrancy/) | The Reentrancy attack is one of the most destructive attacks in the Solidity smart contract. A reentrancy attack occurs when a function makes an external call to another untrusted contract |
| [Front Running](https://coinsbench.com/front-running-hack-solidity-10-57d0765d0179) | The attacker can execute something called the Front-Running Attack wherein, they basically prioritize their transaction over other users by setting higher gas fees |
| [Delegate Call](https://coinsbench.com/unsafe-delegatecall-part-1-hack-solidity-5-81d5f295edb6) | In order to update the owner of the HackMe contract, we pass the function signature of the pwn function via abi.encodeWithSignature(“pwn()”) from the malicious contract |
| [Self Destruct](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-hack-smart-contracts-self-destruct-and-solidity) | an attacker can create a contract with a selfdestruct() function, send ether to it, call selfdestruct(target) and force ether to be sent to a target |
| [Block Timestamp Manipulation](https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack/) | To prevent this type of attack do not use block.timestamp in your contract or follow the 15 second rule. The 15 second rule states |
| [Phishing with tx.origin](https://hackernoon.com/hacking-solidity-contracts-using-txorigin-for-authorization-are-vulnerable-to-phishing) | Let’s say a call could be made to the vulnerable contract that passes the authorization check since tx.origin returns the original sender of the transaction which in this case is the authorized account |

# CONTRACTS

# WARLOCK

This contract is a marketplace contract, it allows to register different marketplaces under a specific structure

## STRUCTURE

```javascript
struct Market {
    uint256 id;
    uint256 value;
    Consumer[] consumers;
    string uri;
    string externalUrl;
    bytes32 name;
    bytes32 purchasesQuantity;
}
```

Once the marketplaces, anyone can buy the product from that marketplace.

Each purchase is recorded on the blockchain in a structure linked to a market:

```javascript
struct Purchase {
    uint256 market;
    uint256 value;
    address consumer;
    bytes32 quantity;
    bytes32 status; //shipping //waiting
}
```

And its status can be updated by the owner.

```javascript

```

Each buyer is registered on the blockchain in a linked structure:

```javascript
struct Consumer {
    uint256 totalPurchase;
    address addr;
    Purchase[] purchases;
}
```

## SETTER

You can add, update or delete markets.

```javascript
function setMarkets(Market[] calldata newMarkets) external onlyOwner {
    delete markets;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < newMarkets.length; i++) {
      markets.push(newMarkets[i]);
    }
}
```

```javascript
function addMarket(Market calldata newMarket) external onlyOwner {
    markets.push(newMarket);
}
```

```javascript
function updateMarket(Market calldata newMarket, uint256 key) external onlyOwner {
    markets[key] = newMarket;
}
```

```javascript
function removeMarket(uint256 id) external onlyOwner {
    delete markets[id];
}
```

Products can be purchased by anyone in exchange for crypto

```javascript
function buyInMarket(uint256 marketId, bytes32 quantity) external payable {
    require(msg.value >= markets[marketId].value * asciiToInteger(quantity));
    require(
      asciiToInteger(markets[marketId].currentLimit) + asciiToInteger(quantity) <
        asciiToInteger(markets[marketId].maxLimit)
    );
    Purchase memory purchase = Purchase({
      market: marketId,
      quantity: quantity,
      value: msg.value,
      consumer: msg.sender,
      status: STATUS_IN_ORDER
    });
    purchases[msg.sender][consumers[msg.sender].totalPurchase] = purchase;
    consumers[msg.sender].purchases.push(purchase);
    consumers[msg.sender].totalPurchase++;
    if (consumers[msg.sender].addr != msg.sender) consumers[msg.sender].addr = msg.sender;
    if (existsInConsumers(msg.sender, markets[marketId].consumers) == false)
      markets[marketId].consumers.push(consumers[msg.sender]);
}
```

## GUETTER

```javascript
function getMarkets() external view returns (Market[] memory) {
    return markets;
}
```

```javascript
function getMarket(uint256 marketId) external view returns (Market memory) {
    return markets[marketId];
  }
```

```javascript
function getConsumer(address consumerAddress) external view returns (Consumer memory) {
    return consumers[consumerAddress];
  }
```

```javascript
function getMarketConsumers(uint256 marketId)
    external
    view
    returns (Consumer[] memory)
  {
    return markets[marketId].consumers;
  }
```

```javascript
function getPurchasesConsumer(address consumerAddress)
    external
    view
    returns (Purchase[] memory)
  {
    Purchase[] memory consumerPurcharses;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < consumers[consumerAddress].totalPurchase; i++) {
      consumerPurcharses[i] = purchases[consumerAddress][i];
    }
    return consumerPurcharses;
  }
```
