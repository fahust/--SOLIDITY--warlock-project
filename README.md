# CONTRACTS


# Evolvable
This contract is based on [ThirdWeb's ERC1155 drop contract](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/drop/DropERC1155.sol).

We added the token burn and mint principle: an NFT owner can burn his token and redeem another one with an other ID, as seen on the [Adidas original contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x28472a58a490c5e09a238847f66a68a47cc76f0f#code).

This contract aims to allow a brand to sell tokens during a period determined by the brand and then let the users who own this token update it during another period.

For a specific phase (**ClaimCondition** struct) the brand can set up 2 arrays **cardIdToMint** and **cardIdToRedeem**: the ids in **cardIdToMint** are the token ids a NFT owner can burn to redeem an oher token with an id (of his choice) in **cardIdToMint**

We want the brands to be as free as possible to customize parameters:

- Possibility to make a phase exclusively accessible to pre-defined NFT owners (ERC721 or ERC1155).
- Possibility to freeze the token if its ID is smaller than the **blockLowerIdToMint** variable.
- Possibility to add a price to the burn-and-mint process (**redeemTokenForOther()**)
- Possibility for the user to choose the token he wants to burn in a list of **cardIdToRedeem** linked to the **claimCondition** active.
- Possibility for the user to choose the token he wants to mint in a list of **cardIdToMint** linked to the **claimCondition** active.
- Possibility to ask for a burn or not (if the array **cardIdToRedeem** linked to the active **claimCondition** is empty)
- Possibility to make the user pay for a burn/mint (**redeemTokenForOther()**) or a mint if the variable **pricePerToken** linked to the **claimCondition** active is > 0

**Most of the functions are identical to our drop contract summarized above. Here are the only added functions :**

### function claim
Allows a brandâ€™s client to mint a new token, according to the current ClaimCondition (fixed by the current timestamp), in exchange of one of his token or a given price (or both), then send the funds to the beneficiaries.

- If the active **ClaimCondition** contains a Merkle root, then the brand's client will need to send a hexadecimal proof of his address..

- If **cardIdToRedeem** array in the **ClaimCondition** length is equal to 0, **claim()** function call **mintClaimedTokens()** function for automaticaly mint token.

- If **cardIdToRedeem** array in the **ClaimCondition** length is greater than 0, **claim()** function call **redeemTokenForOther()** function to automatically burn and mint token whose id is chosen by the client in cardIdToMint of the active ClaimCondition.

**And add them:**

### function redeemTokenForOther
This function allows the brand's customers to burn one of his token to redeem an other token.
